## 4.3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant [RFC6749-4.3]

The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
cases where the `resource owner` has a trust relationship with the
`client`, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged
application. The `authorization server` should take special care when
enabling this grant type and only allow it when other flows are not
viable.

This grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
`resource owner`'s credentials (username and password, typically using
an interactive form). It is also used to migrate existing `client`s
using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
`access token`.

Steps:

1. [4.3.2. Access Token Request](./4.3.2.%20access%20token%20request.md)
2. `5.1. Successful Response`
3. `5.2. Error Response`
