## 4.2. Implicit Grant [RFC6749-4.2]

The implicit grant type is used to obtain `access token`s (it does not
support the issuance of `refresh tokens`) and is optimized for public
clients known to operate a particular redirection URI. These clients
are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language
such as JavaScript.

Since this is a redirection-based flow, the `client` must be capable of
interacting with the `resource owner`'s `user-agent` (typically a web
browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
from the `authorization server`.

Unlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes
separate requests for authorization and for an `access token`, the
client receives the `access token` as the result of the authorization
request.

The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and
relies on the presence of the `resource owner` and the registration of
the redirection URI. Because the `access token` is encoded into the
redirection URI, it may be exposed to the `resource owner` and other
applications residing on the same device.
