## 4.4. Client Credentials Grant  [RFC6749-4.4]

The `client` can request an `access token` using only its client
credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
`client` is requesting access to the protected resources under its
control, or those of another `resource owner` that have been previously
arranged with the `authorization server` (the method of which is beyond
the scope of this specification).

The client credentials grant type MUST only be used by confidential clients.

Steps:

1. [4.4.2. Access Token Request](./4.4.2.%20access%20token%20request.md)
2. `5.1. Successful Response`
3. `5.2. Error Response`
