### 4.1.3. Access Token Request [RFC6749-4.1.3]

The `client` makes a request to the `token endpoint` by sending the
following parameters using the `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`
format with a character encoding of UTF-8 in the HTTP
request **entity-body**.

If the `client` type is `confidential` or the `client` was issued client
credentials (or assigned other authentication requirements), the
`client` MUST authenticate with the `authorization server`
as described in [RFC6749-3.2.1].

#### Notes for `authorization server`

The `authorization server` MUST:

- require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
  client that was issued client credentials (or with other
  authentication requirements),
- authenticate the client if client authentication is included,
- ensure that the authorization code was issued to the authenticated
  confidential client, or if the client is public, ensure that the
  code was issued to "client_id" in the request,
- verify that the authorization code is valid, and
- ensure that the "redirect_uri" parameter is present if the
  "redirect_uri" parameter was included in the initial authorization
  request as described in Section 4.1.1, and if included ensure that
  their values are identical.

#### Example:

```http request
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
