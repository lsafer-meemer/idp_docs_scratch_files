## 4.1. Authorization Code Grant [RFC6749-4.1]

The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both `access token`s
and `refresh token`s and is optimized for confidential clients.

Since this is a redirection-based flow, the `client` must be capable of
interacting with the `resource owner`'s `user-agent` (typically a web
browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
from the `authorization server`.

Steps:

1. [4.1.1. Authorization Request](./4.1.1.%20authorization%20request.md)
2. [4.1.2. Authorization Response](./4.1.2.%20authorization%20response.md)
3. [4.1.2.1 Error Response](./4.1.2.1.%20error%20response.md)
4. [4.1.3. Access Token Request](./4.1.3.%20access%20token%20request.md)
5. `5.1. Successful Response`
6. `5.2. Error Response`
