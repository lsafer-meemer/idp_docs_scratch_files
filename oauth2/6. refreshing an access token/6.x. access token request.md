### 6.x. Access Token Request [RFC6749-6]

If the `authorization server` issued a `refresh token` to the `client`, the
`client` makes a refresh request to the `token endpoint` by adding the
following parameters using the `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`
format in the HTTP request **entity-body**:

Because `refresh token`s are typically long-lasting credentials used to
request additional `access token`s, the `refresh token` is bound to the
`client` to which it was issued.

If the client type is confidential or the client was issued client credentials
(or assigned other authentication requirements), the `client` MUST authenticate
with the authorization server as described in [RFC6749-3.2.1].

The `authorization server` MAY issue a new `refresh token`, in which case
the `client` MUST discard the old `refresh token` and replace it with the
new `refresh token`. The `authorization server` MAY revoke the old
`refresh token` after issuing a new `refresh token` to the `client`.

If a new `refresh token` is issued, the `refresh token` `scope` MUST be
identical to that of the `refresh token` included by the `client` in the
request.

#### Notes for `authorization server`

The authorization server MUST:

- require client authentication for confidential clients or for any
  `client` that was issued client credentials (or with other
  authentication requirements),
- authenticate the `client` if client authentication is included and
  ensure that the `refresh token` was issued to the authenticated
  client, and
- validate the `refresh token`.

#### Example:

```http request
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA
```

#### Parameters

```
format: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
location: entity body
delivery: connection
```

`grant_type`
: REQUIRED. Value MUST be set to `refresh_token`.

`refresh_token`
: REQUIRED. The refresh token issued to the client.

`scope`
: OPTIONAL. The `scope` of the access request as described by [RFC6749-3.3].
The requested `scope` MUST NOT include any scope
not originally granted by the `resource owner`, and if omitted is
treated as equal to the `scope` originally granted by the
`resource owner`.
